### Project Management

This project will be run utilizing the [Agile Kanban methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban).

All development tasks associated with the project will first be created as Kanban cards added to the following Kanban board:

https://github.com/codeforboston/mattapan-mapping/issues

This project uses the [Task Branching methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/branching).

Any changes to the codebase should occur in a separate branch created specifically to implement the work associated with a specific Kanban card.

The naming convention for each branch should be: **Kanban Task Name** - **Release Name**.

For instance: 

        implement-mapping-feature-1.0.0
        

Developers will create all changes necessary to implement a task/feature in a single branch, and each task/feature branch 
will undergo a team code review prior to being merged to the Main branch of the project.

Code reviews and merges will be submitted via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/features/code-review/).
